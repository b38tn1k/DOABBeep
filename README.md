# DOABBeep
worst 303 ever

Monophonic Acid-y sounding bass synth with MIDI input.

[I started with the Auduino project](https://code.google.com/archive/p/tinkerit/wikis/Auduino.wiki)

The [MIDI PCM Sample player](https://github.com/b38tn1k/MIDI_PCM_Sampler) was not very useful. This fits in the same case with the same circuitry :-) There are probably better ways to use the pots, worth experimenting or just adding more pots ;-)

For some Arduino variants output is on pin 3 rather than 11.

GPIOs per the .ino sketch:
